This code processes a dataset from a corner of a simulation, containing the positions of over 30 million particles. 

It first uses kdtree to compute particle distances, 
then applies FOF halo finding with [halotools](https://github.com/astropy/halotools), 
and finally generates a halo mass function plot using [Colossus](https://bdiemer.bitbucket.io/colossus/index.html).
